# My Machine Learning Journey

> Learning ML from scratch - one algorithm at a time

## About This Repository

This repo documents my journey learning Machine Learning from the ground up. Instead of just using libraries, I'm implementing algorithms **from scratch** to truly understand how they work.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for comparison)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Ali-reza-rn/ml-journey.git
cd ml-journey

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Navigate to a project
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook linear_regression.ipynb
```

## Notes

This is a learning journey. Code might not be perfect, but it's **honest**. Every mistake is a lesson learned!
